    <p>It's not easy living next to the edge.  True, I am not on the edge itself,
lucky for me The Edge is an hour drive away.  The Edge is the name of a mosque
in Jerusalem from which a terror wave broke out about a week ago.</p>
<p>Today it reached us.  At 3 PM, a terrorist stabbed 4 Israelies in
central Tel Aviv just a couple of miles from my home.  It is scary especially as
our leaders can hardly find their ass hole with both hands.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the dark days of "The Split Screen" in 2002
when TV news had to use a split screen to track the sucide bombings and
of 1994 when the street next to my home was closed for hours becuase the Rabbis
had to make sure there's no piece of human flesh left on any of the trees.</p>
<p>This time it's diffrent (ain't it always?).  The terrorists have only knives
and it's clear there is no driving organization behind this. It's people who
wake up one morning and decide to get a knife and hit the streets of
Israeli cities and kill as many jews as possible.</p>
<p>Like it normally does, the terror wave started in the heart of Jerusalem at
The Edge Mosque at Temple Mount.  The same tiny place (150,000 m2) humans
have been fighting over for 3 millenias and a torn in every empires' back since
the days of the babylonians.</p>
<p><img alt="Jerusalem Topology" src="http://geographyeducationdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/holylandelevation.jpg?w=593&amp;h=466"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Temple Mount forms the northern portion of a very narrow spur of hill that
slopes sharply downward from north to south. Rising above the Kidron Valley to
the east and Tyropoeon Valley to the west,[13] its peak reaches a height of 740
m (2,428 ft) above sea level.[14] In around 19 BCE, Herod the Great extended the
Mount's natural plateau by enclosing the area with four massive retaining walls
and filling the voids. This artificial expansion resulted in a large flat
expanse which today forms the eastern section of the Old City of Jerusalem. The
trapezium shaped platform measures 488 m along the west, 470 m along the east,
315 m along the north and 280 m along the south, giving a total area
of approximately 150,000 m2 (37 acres). (wikipedia)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has to be topological reason this place to be so precious and I believe
the map above has some pretty convincing clues. First, an easy slope west &amp; down
to the sea makes it the eastern most city connected to the mediterranean ports and cities.
Second, the lowest place on earth is just to the East with a drop 3,800 ft. from the city
forming a steep barrier between Jerusalem and the near East.</p>
<p>The Profit gave The Edge it's fitting name - coming from the east it sure
looks like the edge, separating east from west.</p>
<p>The terror we're wittensing is a result of a clash between east and west.
It has a new social structure and a new communication network in the from of
the Interent and we must use the power of the network to lower the flames.</p>
<p>, the shape of social netwroks on the Internet that
spread hatered and motivate young people to become terrorists.
The Internet helps the is powerful weapon and in the hands </p>
<p>south I'll soon have to join guard duty at my girl's kindergarten.</p>
