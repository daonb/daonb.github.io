  <div class="article">
    <p>It's been an interesting first year of freelancing at The Museum of
The Jewish People.  I wrote a lot of code, released quite a few versions
and met some very good people.</p>
<p>Together we've opened some of the code of our databases site, published an
<a href="http://devapi.dbs.bh.org.il/v1/docs">API</a> and started
using creative commons licenses. We're now probably the most advanced Museum
in Israel when it comes to digital assets and we keep pushing that envelope.</p>
<p>So when I met Daphne in a <em>Django Girls</em> meetup and heard about HackExtend
I offered to help and make it happen at the Museum.</p>
<h2>AND IT'S HAPPENING!</h2>
<p>In a fortnight, at the 15-16/9/2016, I'll be hacking in the first ever
HackExtend right here, at Beit-Hatfutsot - The Museum of The Jewish People - and the hit is on.  The Museum's have put a lot of time into this and I have to prove
It's worth it, so we can have many more Hackathon's at our excellent
facilities - two auditorium with 100 &amp; 200 seats, 10 class rooms and the gardens
of Tel Aviv University.</p>
<p>My original plan was to prepare a lot of <a href="https://github.com/Beit-Hatfutsot/dbs-front/labels/beginner">beginner issues</a> and help people
install the environment, pick an issue, fix it and submit a pull request.
It's all very nice but after the pre-hackathon meetup last Friday,
I understood these tasks don't fit those that are a part of a team as teams
need a project.  So we've banged our heads together and came with four small
projects that are we'd love to have and are fun to develop.</p>
<p>Here they are for your consideration,  ordered from the dullest to the coolest:</p>
<h3>Admin Interface</h3>
<p>We have registered users and we have roles, but no way to manage them.
When I need to make someone an <em>editor</em> I have to launch the python shell on
the server and run a couple of commands.  While it's been fun playing with the
shell, we can really use and Admin interface to manage users and roles.</p>
<p>This project needs a bit of UX design, frontend (preferably angular 2) and some
backend (flask-user).</p>
<h3>My Story revamp</h3>
<p>We have a section on the site where registered users can collect items
, group them in branches and share them with the world. It works - 
here's <a href="http://test.dbs.bh.org.il/story/2e775e50cffbe657e7179569822f002b">my story</a>
- but it needs some serious face lifting.</p>
<p>We need to name branches automatically based on the Place &amp; Family the user searched for.
Good branch names will allow us to improve our 'Related' links which are now
terrible (based on elasticsearch's more-like-this feature) as we can find
related items in users' branches i.e. For 'Paris' the related items are
those that appear in more then one branch named <em>Paris</em>.</p>
<p>At the display front, we need to let the user control the order of the
cards - i.e. put my grandmother's card first - and possibly over their size.
It'll also be nice to let users customize as much of the display as possible -
many of the users will be kids, researching their family roots, and they
love customizing.</p>
<p>And we need to make it easier to put items directly into the branch I'm
currently researching.</p>
<p>This project needs UX design and angular 1.4 coding on our frontend.  Netta, our
resident designer, will help, explaining UI guidelines and sharing photoshop
files.</p>
<h3>Family Tree Creator</h3>
<p>So far we've only developed a <em>read</em> interface to the family trees and users
are demanding a way to create and edit trees.  A Creation interface is simpler
so we want to focus on that as the first step, allowing registered users to 
create their own tree.</p>
<p>The challenge here is to use the interface you develop to create a complex tree,
like <a href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%AA%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%AA:%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%9F_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%97%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%A9%D7%9C_%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA">the one from Genesis</a>.</p>
<h3>Visitors Visualization for the Physical World</h3>
<p>At the entrance to the Museum we have a wall with 9 screens forming a 16:9
rectangle with a diagonal of 126 inches.  It currently shows clips from Jewish
Weddings and we want to replace it with a live world map of visitor to the site
and the content viewed.  The winning visualization will run on that wall and
will put a small plaque with the names of the team members.</p>
<p>The logs are published using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview">google's pub/sub</a>
service and ip to geo seems straight forward enough -  I installed locally
<a href="https://github.com/fiorix/freegeoip">freegeoip</a> and it works like a charm.</p>
<p>This will require some creative UX/UI design, simple backend and a small webapp,
preferably using angular 2.</p>
